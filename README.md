Incomplete flow [library interface definitions](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/) we use in our projects.

## Installation

First, install the package by running:

```bash
$ yarn add @anvilabs/flow-libdefs --dev
# or
$ npm install @anvilabs/flow-libdefs --save-dev
```

Then add the following to your `.flowconfig`:

```ini
...
[libs]
node_modules/@anvilabs/flow-libdefs/definitions/
...
```

Alternatively, add definitions for each library separately:

```ini
...
[libs]
node_modules/@anvilabs/flow-libdefs/definitions/lodash.js
node_modules/@anvilabs/flow-libdefs/definitions/recompact.js
...
```
